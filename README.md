# BrainrotBrowserExtension

this is a chrome browser extension that turns the content on the page into "brainrot"

Overlaying the captions of the article on a minecraft parkour video as a TTS (text to speach) reads it aloud. 

If you want to use it yourself go to the chrome extensions page, go into developer mode, and load the build file.
