# BrainrotBrowserExtension

this is a chrome browser extension that turns the content on the page into "brainrot"

Overlaying the captions of the article on a minecraft parkour video as a TTS (text to speach) reads it aloud. 

If you want to use it yourself go to the chrome extensions page, go into developer mode, and load the build file. 

The video is low quality for space conservation reasons. Go ahead and change the .mp4 if you seek fit, just make sure your name it the same
